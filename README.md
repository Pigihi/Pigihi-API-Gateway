# API Gateway

All external communication go through API Gateway

## Configuration

Edit the properties of **application.yml**Â file

```yaml
# Eureka properties
eureka:
  client:
    fetch-registry: true
    register-with-eureka: true
    service-url:
      defaultZone: address of the eureka server (Eg: http://localhost:8761/eureka)
  instance:
    hostname: specify the hostname here (Eg: localhost)

# Server properties
server:
  port: port in which the API Gateway is to be run (Eg: 8191)

# Application properties
spring:
  application:
    name: name of the application (Eg: API-GATEWAY)
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: name of the microservice (Eg: CUSTOMER-SERVICE)
          uri: load-balancing uri (Eg: lb://CUSTOMER-SERVICE)
          predicates:
            - Path= path that should be handled by this microservice (Eg: /user/customer/**)
```

## Local Deployment

All the microservices are specified using their application name. Service Registry should be started for successful execution of queries.

In application.yml file, change the properties

| Property | Value | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| eureka_hostname | hostname of eureka service | service-registry |

### Using Docker

Create docker bridge network: `docker network create -d bridge pigihi-network`

docker-compose can be used to run the application and the corresponding mongodb instance

1.  Go to project folder
2.  Open terminal and run `docker-compose up`
3.  The application can be accessed at localhost:8191 (port 8191 is set in docker-compose)
4.  All the applications within the pigihi-network can access this application using the service name specified in docker-compose (.i.e. by default, service-registry)

To run only the application

1. Go to project folder
2. Open terminal and run `docker build .`
3. Run `docker run -p 8191:8191 docker_image_name`

### Using gradle

MongoDB should be run seperately and the configurations should be updated in application.yml

1. Go to project folder
2. Open terminal and run `./gradlew build`
3. Run `./gradlew bootRun`
